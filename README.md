# whale-shark-movement Project

## Plan

The broader aim of this project is to reconstruct whale shark movement trajectories from irregular satellite tracking data using state-space models, and to create a clean movement dataset that can later be linked to oceanographic conditions and other spatial environmental factors. The idea is to move beyond raw observation tracks and work with movement representations that are easier to compare across individuals, and more useful for exploring spatial patterns and environment–movement relationships in later analyses.

## Content

This repository currently includes exploratory work on:

- Basic data checks and initial exploration of Argos telemetry
- State-space model fitting and diagnostic visualization
- Move persistence modelling
- Early data extraction and mapping

## Status 

This is an active work in progress. Many modelling choices are still being explored, and the structure and contents of the repository are expected to change as the project develops.
