# Whale Shark Movement Project

## Plan

This project aims to reconstruct whale shark movement trajectories from irregular satellite tracking data using state-space models, and to create a clean movement dataset that can later be linked to oceanographic conditions and other spatial environmental factors. The idea is to move beyond raw observation tracks and work with movement representations that are easier to compare across individuals, and more useful for exploring spatial patterns and environment–movement relationships in later analyses.

## Repository Structure

**analysis/**

Contains source R Markdown files for each analysis stage. Each file corresponds to a distinct scientific question.

- 01_main_movement_analysis.Rmd
Baseline movement modelling, including fitted and predicted tracks and movement persistence over time.

- 02_time_step_sensitivity.Rmd
Sensitivity analysis examining the impact of different temporal resolutions on movement model outputs.

**results/**

Rendered HTML outputs generated from the analysis files. These are provided for quick review without running code.

**figures/**

Final figures generated by the analyses. Figures are organised by analysis stage.

**workflow/**

High level workflow overview of the project.

## Data Availability

Telemetry data are not included in this repository due to usage restrictions.

## Reproducibility

All figures and results in the results/ and figures/ directories are generated from the corresponding files in analysis/.
